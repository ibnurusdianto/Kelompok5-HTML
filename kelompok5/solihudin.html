    Best wishes for all of us. Before starting allow me to introduce myself.
    Let me introduce myself, my name is Solihudin from the university of informatics.
    On this occasion, 
    I am here to deliver a short speech with the theme of several things 
    that must be considered when choosing the next president, 
    which we all know that being a leader is not an easy thing, especially to lead a country, 
    I have participated in the presidential election in 2019, 
    therefore in my opinion what are the things that a country leader must have, namely:
    
    1. Background
    Knowing the background of the presidential candidate who will be elected. 
    Presidential candidates must have a history of being free and clean from all kinds of criminal acts.
    
    2.Vision and mission
    A good president must have clear goals in order to bring this nation and country to prosperity. 
    A good president does not give up easily, is tenacious, diligent, has a strong mentality, 
    is willing to learn from failure and always tries to be the best of the best.
    
    3.program
    A good president is a president who has prepared any programs that 
    will be realized in the future for the progress of the nation
    
    4. Responsible
    A good leader is a leader who dares to take responsibility for whatever happens in the future 
    and does not release his responsibilities until his term ends.
    
    5. honest
    A good leader is an honest leader because honesty not only brings him to goodness, 
    but also leads the people he leads to goodness as well.
    
    In my opinion, 
    those are some things that must be considered when choosing a presidential candidate in the future.
    
    ok let's close this session
    even if only for a few minutes I delivered this speech. 
    I hope that it will be useful for the voters of future presidential leaders.
    Thank you for your attention
